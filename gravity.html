                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Gravity is a fundamental force in the universe, the behavior of bodies in the universe is controlled by gravity but how does it work?</p>
                <p>The law of universal gravitation was postulated by Sir Isaac Newton and states that in the Universe every material point attracts every other material point with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance.</p>

               <h2>What are orbits?</h2>
               <p>Before talking about orbits we need to know what escape velocity is. Escape velocity (ve) is the minimum velocity needed to escape the gravitational field of a body, for example on Earth it is 11.2 km/s.
                Now that we know what escape velocity is, let's talk about orbits. An orbit is the trajectory of a body A around another body B of mass m>mA. Now let's imagine throwing a ball with a cannon, the ball falls and we throw it again but with greater power and it falls but it goes further, I repeat the action and it goes further and by continuing to make attempts we will be able to throw the ball with such power as to make it fall infinitely around the Earth</p>
